# Flashcards: Quiz Yourself

This project was bootstrapped with Create React Native App using [Expo](https://expo.io/).

**Flashcards** was created as part of *Udacity's React Nanodegree Program* and fulfills the UdaciCards application rubric.

## Project Description

The application allows users to create card decks in which they manage questions and answers. Once a user has added cards to their deck, they can quiz themselves. At the end of the quiz, they are given a simple score representing how many correct answers they marked.


## Running the Project

Before starting the project, you will need to add the required scripts to your project. These dependencies are noted in `package.json` and can be added to your project by running:

```
$ yarn install
```

Once dependencies are installed and you're ready to start the project, you can run:

```
$ yarn start
```

This runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:19002](http://localhost:19002) to access Dev Tools from your browser.

If you already have the required setup for running Android and iOS emulators on your machine, simply press `i` or `a` in your terminal to open the virtual machines.

The app will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### Other Options
If you don't have emulators running locally, download the Expo app for your physical mobile device, open it and then scan the QR code located in your terminal.

Additionally, if you do not have access to any of these options, you can use [Expo Snack](https://snack.expo.io) to move forward by copying the files into a project there.
